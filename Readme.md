When I started to think about this project i thinked what libraries I should need, if I'm going to use redux or react-navigation. Because these libraries need to be setted up in the beginning of the project. I decided to use both of the libraries in order to give the app a more robust architecture. After that I thought about two main screens, the first one just showing the list of notes, and the second one which was going to create or edit a new note. I gave priority to the functionality over the looks because it's a showcase project.
