When i started to think about this project i thinked what libraries should i need, if im going to use redux or react-navigation.
Because this libraries need to be seted up in the begining of the project. I decided to use both of the libraries in order to give the app a more robust architecture.
After that i thought about two main screens, the first one just showing the list of notes, and second one which was going to create or edit a new note.
I gave priority to the functionalty over the looks because its a showcase project.
