When I started to think about this project, i thought what libraries I might need and if Iâ€™m going to use redux or react-navigation. Because these libraries need to be set up in the beginning of the project, I decided to use both of the libraries in order to give the app a more robust architecture.

After that I thought about two main screens, the first one just showing the list of notes, and the second one which was going to create or edit a new note. I gave priority to the functionality over the looks because it's a showcase project. Also I installed a library to add the feature of swipe to delete the cells of the list because react-native doesnt have it.

## Installation

```bash
yarn

yarn ios
```
